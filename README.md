# WAPORPIP
generic tools and pipelines that support utilization of WaPOR data as part of  the Water Productivity in Practice project (WaterPIP: https://waterpip.un-ihe.org/welcome-waterpip)

To provide you with some background: The key policy priority of the Dutch Development 
Cooperation official DGIS policy is to enhance water productivity in the agricultural sector 
by 25%. Water productivity is agricultural production per unit of water consumed, and supports 
evidence based discussions and decisions on water use in agriculture. The WaterPIP project was 
established to guide DGIS partner countries and water projects in water productivity concepts 
to reach this 25% water productivity improvement using WaPOR. 

The FAO Water Productivity Open-access portal (WaPOR) uses remote sensing technologies to monitor 
and report on agricultural water productivity over Africa and the Near East from 2009 to present. 
Within Work package 2 of the WaterPIP project we aim to improve access to and interpretation/analysis/usage 
of WaPOR data and information by (co-)developing applications.

We are currently working on generic applications that use the WaPOR database for analysis (statistics, anomalies, trends), 
allow visualization of data (graphs and maps exporter) and support dissemination (report generator).
