Increasing competition for and limited availability of water and land resources puts a serious constraint on agricultural production systems. Sustainable land and water management practices will be critical to expand production efficiently and address food insecurity while limiting the impact on the ecosystem. This requires a good understanding of how agricultural systems are performing, what are the underlying causes of spatio-temporal performance variations and the existing potential for improvement. Therefore, building satellite observations based tools to analyse and compare agriculture and irrigation performances is vital. 

This repo hosts tools to extract, interpret, analyse and visualize open-access geodata to improve water productivity. Currently, the focus is on data such as available in the FAO WaPOR database but also other open-access datasets will be considered in future. The tools in this repo can be used as building blocks to create customized services to target specific user needs.

## Release Notes

#### 0.2 2022/2/10

- first version of the WaPORAct package as part of the waterpip project. Includes basic framework for producing actionable data in a repeatable and clear manner based of the available WAPOR datasets using generic tools. 

## In Development 

- screenshots to support installation wiki
- addition of visualisations to the wapor_pai.py pipeline
- functions to create static maps in plots.py
- complex statistical analysis tutorial for waporact basics tutorials
- crop yield factor pipeline

The Water Productivity Improvement in Practice (WaterPIP) project is supported by the Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands under the IHE Delft Partnership Programme for Water and Development (DUPC2). WaterPIP aims to guide countries and water projects in Water Productivity concepts to reach 25% WP improvement in the agricultural sector using WaPOR. It is lead by [IHE Delft](https://www.un-ihe.org/) in partnership with [Wageningen University and Research Center (WUR)](https://www.wur.nl/), [MetaMeta](https://metameta.nl), [eLEAF](https://www.eleaf.com) and [FAO](https://www.fao.org).
