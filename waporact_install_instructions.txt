waporact package setup:

1. Download Miniconda and run the .exe-file

miniconda url: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

save the program in C:\Miniconda3 or similar (avoid paths with spaces)

if you are not allowed to create this folder, create it manually via FileExplorer before to run the installer
allow adding to system environment variables when asked

if you miss the chance to add conda to your env variables. You can do this manually by searchign for *advanced system settings* in windows search bar, opening it and then click on *environmental variables* opening a new window.

Then in this window add ..\Miniconda3 (your version of the path) to the Path variable.

Having done this conda should be available from the terminal

If having issues beyond this point look it up online. Google and stackoverflow provide alot of anwsers

2. Next open command terminal and run 

`conda info` (do not enter the `` marks)

it should return some info about conda. if it does not work even after restarting the terminal there is something wrong with your environmental variables or conda installation.

Once it does work you can setup the waporact environment

- navigate to the directory containing the waporact.yml file by typing in 'cd' then the path to the directory as below:

`cd <path>/git/waporact` (enter your path in <path>)

- create the conda environment from the yml file by runnin the floowling in the terminal once you are in the waporact directory:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

- activate the environment to check:

`conda activate waporact`

-  the new env should have activated for you and should be visible on the left in your terminal next to where you are typing

- Next change to the location of the cloned repository

`cd <path>/git/waporact` (enter your path in <path>) if needed

Note: make sure your in the waporact working directory, this is the folder that holds the file setup.py:

- then install the waporact package itself using the setup.py file by running:

`pip install .`
