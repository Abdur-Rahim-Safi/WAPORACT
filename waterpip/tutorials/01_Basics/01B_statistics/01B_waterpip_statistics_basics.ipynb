    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "All the waterpip functions have been organized into classes to help automate as much of the process as possible. Most importantly is that folder structuring and naming is automated by calling on and intiating the *WaporStructure* class in the background. A user sets their project directory using the *waterpip_directory* and *project_name* inputs and the functions take care of the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### WARNING: \n",
    "This analysis example requires the folder structure built while running and downloading data using the WaporRetrieval class. Please see 01_waterpip_download_basics for more info. It is not recommended to run this notebook on data not downloaded using WaporRetrieval (but it is possible if you get into the code)*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NOTE: \n",
    "If this is your first time running this please read the instructions below  and then follow the steps to analyse the data. "

    "\n",
    "This class was made to make analyzing data retrieved from the WAPOR portal easy. To intiate the class you need to enter/edit the following inputs below:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: \n",
    "Use the same inputs as found in the class WaporRetrieval. Except that the api_token is only required if retrieving data. In the case of using data retrieved using WaporRetrieval the clas inputsd here should be literally the same*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **waterpip_directory**: path to the directory where the project specific directory will be created. the class *WaporRetrieval* automatically creates a new directory using the input *project_name* on activation and creates subfolders to organise the data as well. The functions that follow automatically use these folders (**required**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **shapefile_path**: the shapefile is a needed input that specifies the location to download data for as well as the projection to output it in. Directly the input is the path to the shapefile itself. The function retrieves the data for the area(s) shown in the shapefile  (**required**). ***Note***: A shapefile is required and provides alot of the required info for the project including the extent and the output projection. Any projection (crs) is accepted, wapor data is  always downloaded in epsg: 4326 and the shapefile bounding box is transformed as needed to match. transformations are made again if needed to retrieve the data and transform it to match the projection (crs) of the input shapefile. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **wapor_level**: level of WAPOR data to download. There are 3 levels from low resolution 250m (1) and mid resolution 100m (2) to high resolution 30m (3). All of Africa and part of the middle east is available at level 1. Specific countries are available at level 2. Only some specific locations around the size of valleys or hydrosheds are available at level 3. For more info on the levels please see: https://wapor.apps.fao.org/home/WAPOR_2/1  (**required**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: A spatial check is carried out on the download area specified in your shapefile to see if data is available for it at the given level when running (only level 1 and 3 spatial checks exist currently). Error messages provide details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **project_name**: name of the directory that will be created, all data retrieved and analysed can be found in here, auto set to *test* if not provided."
