    "All the waterpip functions have been organized into classes to help automate as much of the process as possible. Most importantly is that folder structuring and naming is automated by calling on and intiating the *WaporStructure* class in the background. A user sets their project directory using the *waterpip_directory* and *project_name* inputs and the functions take care of the rest. \n",

    "#### 3.1 Initiate/activate the class *WaporRetrieval*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background info: *WaporRetrieval* uses (inherits) the class *WaporAPI* originally written by Bich Tran at IHE Delft for the various open source WAPOR packages released by IHE DELFT. It is a great package for accessing the WAPOR data via API and if you want more flexibility in your implementation or if you want to dive into the code directly; I recommend you check out the original code available via their packages on GIT. You can also check out the edited version of their *WaporAPI* class that can be found in this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "to intiate the class you need to enter/edit the following inputs below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **waterpip_directory**: path to the directory where the project specific directory will be created. the class *WaporRetrieval* automatically creates a new directory using the input *project_name* on activation and creates subfolders to organise the data as well. The functions that follow automatically use these folders (**required**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **shapefile_path**: the shapefile is a needed input that specifies the location to download data for as well as the projection to output it in. Directly the input is the path to the shapefile itself. The function retrieves the data for the area(s) shown in the shapefile  (**required**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: A shapefile is required and provides alot of the required info for the project including the extent and the output projection. Any projection (crs) is accepted, wapor data is  always downloaded in epsg: 4326 and the shapefile bounding box is transformed as needed to match. transformations are made again if needed to retrieve the data and transform it to match the projection (crs) of the input shapefile. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **wapor_level**: level of WAPOR data to download. There are 3 levels from low resolution 250m (1) and mid resolution 100m (2) to high resolution 30m (3). All of Africa and part of the middle east is available at level 1. Specific countries are available at level 2. Only some specific locations around the size of valleys or hydrosheds are available at level 3. For more info on the levels please see: https://wapor.apps.fao.org/home/WAPOR_2/1  (**required**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: A spatial check is carried out on the download area specified in your shapefile to see if data is available for it at the given level when running (only level 1 and 3 spatial checks exist currently). Error messages provide details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **api_token**: the api token retrieved form the WAPOR site goes here. see the instructions above on how to retrieve a token from the WAPOR website (**required**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **project_name**: name of the directory that will be created, all data retrieved and analysed can be found in here, auto set to *test* if not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following inputs are optional. They can also be provided when running the class functions for more flexibility. The advantage of passing them during clas setup/initialisation is that it is easy to repeatedly use the class functions with the same inputs. That way you are assured it will always run for the same inputs. The advantage of passing the class functions is that it is flexible. by changing only a few inputs you can retrieve different sets of data each time while maintaining the same required class inputs (folder structure, wapor level and area of interest (shapefile) etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **period_start**: date you want to start your data download from, enter as a datetime object. This can also be provided later when running the class functions. Auto sets to the before running if not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **period_end**: date you want to end your data download at, enter as a datetime object. This can also be provided later when \n",
    "running the class functions. Auto sets to the day of running if not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**datetime objects**: A specific way of formatting dates for python. It is made up of the function datetime followed by the date in brackets split into the sections: Year (4 digits), month (2 or 1 digit), day (2 or 1 digits). (google python datetime object for more details)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: November 4th 2020 or 4-11-2020: datetime(2020,11,4)  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: do not use leading zeros for single digit dates (1 not 01). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **return_period**: return period to download data for, given as a single letter code. available periods include: I: Daily, D: Dekadal, S: Seasonal, A: Annual (yearly). This can also be provided later when running the class functions. Auto sets to the Dekadal (D) if not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **datacomponents**: datacomponents (parameters of interest such as transpiration and net primary productivity) to download data for. These are input as single letter code strings seperated by a ',' in a list such as: ['T', 'NPP']. if you set the datacomponents input to ['ALL'] it will download all datacomponents available for that return period and level at that location.
